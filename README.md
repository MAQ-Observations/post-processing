Please note that we offer a very easy to use user interface at https://maq-observations.nl/ to download data and plot graphs. The scripts provided here can be used for users who are experienced with Python (requests), or who want to automate specific processes based on the MAQ-Observations.nl database.

Post-processing/analysis scripts for MAQ-Observations:

- Download_Data.ipynb: To specify user input, request data from database and save to a .csv file. This needs to be tested for other cases.
- Plot_Figures.ipynb: To specify user input and plot requested input to graphs. This is still under construction.
- Tests.ipynb: Very simple json requests to the database, also provided on https://maq-observations.nl/api/.

Please reach out to observations.maq@wur.nl in case of specific questions or requests.
